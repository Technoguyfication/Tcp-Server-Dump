To launch the program simply run it through the command line, specifying the port after the executable.

Example: Tcp-Server-Dump.exe 80
...would dump incoming connections on port 80 to data.raw in the working directory.

No, there aren't any other options. If you want other options, feel free to submit a pull request ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
